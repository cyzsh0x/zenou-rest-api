## Introduction  

This framework provides a simple yet powerful structure for building RESTful APIs. It enables rapid endpoint creation and automatic registration, making it perfect for both small projects and large-scale applications.  

---

## Features  

- **Modular Design**: Easily add or remove endpoints as separate modules.  
- **Automatic Endpoint Registration**: New endpoints are automatically recognized and registered.  
- **Lightweight**: Minimal dependencies for quick setup and performance.  
- **Customizable**: Tailor the framework to fit your specific project needs.  

---

## Getting Started  

To set up the framework locally:  

1. **Clone the Repository**:  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/ajirodesu/zenou-rest-api.git  
   ```  

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:  
   ```bash  
   cd zenou-rest-api  
   ```  

3. **Install Dependencies**:  
   ```bash  
   npm install  
   ```  

4. **Start the Server**:  
   ```bash  
   npm start  
   ```  

The server will start, and you can begin adding your API endpoints.  

---

## Adding an API Endpoint  

To add a new API endpoint, create a JavaScript file in the `api` directory with the following structure:  

```javascript  
exports.config = {  
    name: 'example', // The name of your API  
    description: 'API Description', // Brief description of your API  
    category: 'utility', // The category of your API (e.g., utility, data, etc.)  
    link: ['/example?q=test'] // Example link to access your API  
};  

exports.initialize = async function ({ req, res }) {  
    // Your API logic here  
};  
```  

- **`exports.config`**: Defines metadata for the API, including its name, author, description, category, and example link.  
- **`exports.initialize`**: Contains the main logic for the API endpoint, handling requests and responses.  

---

## Example Endpoint  

Here's an example of a simple "Hello World" API:  

```javascript  
exports.config = {  
    name: 'helloWorld',  
    author: 'Lance Ajiro',  
    description: 'Returns a Hello World message',  
    category: 'example',  
    link: ['/helloWorld']  
};  

exports.initialize = async function ({ req, res }) {  
    res.json({ message: 'Hello, World!' });  
};  
```  

This endpoint responds with a JSON object containing a greeting message when accessed.  

---

## Automatic Endpoint Linking  

The framework automatically registers and displays new API endpoints on the main website interface. There's no need to manually add links or update navigation menus.  

---

## Configuration  

The framework includes a `config.json` file to make it easier to customize key settings for your REST API. Here's an example of what the `config.json` file might look like:  

```json  
{  
  "port": "8080",  
  "title": "Ajiro API",  
  "title2": "Ajiro Rest API",  
  "favicon": "https://i.ibb.co/XYk4dXn/image.png",  
  "notifications": [  
    {  
      "title": "New UI",  
      "description": "We updated our UI to get a cooler experience"  
    },  
    {  
      "title": "New Design",  
      "description": "We updated our design to get a cooler experience"  
    }  
  ]  
}  
```  

### Explanation  

- **`port`**: Defines the port the server will run on (default: 8080).  
- **`title`**: Sets the primary title of the API.  
- **`title2`**: Sets the secondary title for the API.  
- **`favicon`**: URL for the favicon used on the API's main interface.  
- **`notifications`**: A list of notification objects to display updates or messages on the API's main page.  

This file provides flexibility to modify settings without altering the core codebase.
